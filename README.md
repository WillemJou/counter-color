## Features

Welcome everyone !
Here is a funny little application allowing the creation of color palettes randomly, using a counter.
It is possible to copy the hexadecimal code of the color by clicking on it, create palettes of up to three colors and save them for reuse later.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
